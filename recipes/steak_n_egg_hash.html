        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the steak in the cast iron skillet over medium heat, flipping half way through until entirely cooked through. Remove to a plate and reserve the drippings in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes to the skillet and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, (8 to 12 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook until lightly browned and the potatoes are cooked through, (3 to 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Cut steak into pieces and return to skillet, reduce the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Make 4 shallow wells in the potato mixture and crack an egg into each one.</li>
            <li>Scatter the tomatoes throughout the skillet and cover; cooking until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny ( 6 to 12 minutes)</li>
            <li>    Season the eggs with salt and pepper, sprinkle with Italian Seasoning, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
